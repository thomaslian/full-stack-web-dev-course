## Library vs Framework
- Library - A collection of functions which are useful when writing web apps. Your code is in charge and it calls into the library when it sees fit. (Example jQuery)
- Framework - A particular implementation of a web application, where your code fills in the details. The framework is in charge and it calls into your code when it need something app specific. (Example Angular, Ember...)
